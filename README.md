## Prepare Matlab figures for LaTeX & PowerPoint

Since 2014b, Matlab has dramatically improved its figure handling (from terrible to okay-ish). Still, people don't really know how to make their figures look good.

2. For Powerpoint, print your figures in jpg and increase fontsize for readability. And you're done!
