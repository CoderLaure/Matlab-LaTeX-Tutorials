## Prepare Matlab figures for LaTeX & PowerPoint

Since 2014b, Matlab has dramatically improved its figure handling (from terrible to okay-ish). Still, people don't really know how to make their figures look good. 

Here's what I suggest:
1. Use PdfLaTeX for your files, and print your figures in pdf. Copy paste the code snippet after your figure and watch the magic happen! 
2. For Powerpoint, print your figures in jpg and increase fontsize for readability. And you're done!
